# MemShare
Project library to share memory space between multiple processes

This was a quick project designed to figure out how sharing memory between processes works. This is a very simple PoC right now.

## ToDo:
 * Build into malloc to allow a shared malloc.
 * Build a communication channel API to allow processes to notify each other when a memory space is modified.
